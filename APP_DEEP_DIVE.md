# DataCart Storefront - App Deep Dive

## What Is This App?

The DataCart Storefront is a **customer-facing e-commerce web application** that simulates a real online store. It's built as a Databricks App using React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend), connected to a Lakebase PostgreSQL database.

Unlike a typical admin dashboard, this app is designed from the **customer's perspective** — browsing products, checking stock, adding items to a cart, and placing orders. The storefront **auto-detects schema changes** as each workshop lab modifies the database, dynamically revealing new features without redeployment.

## Why a Storefront?

The workshop tells the story of DataCart, an e-commerce company. The key scenarios are:

1. **Parallel development** — Three developers modify the database schema on isolated branches
2. **Schema promotion** — Loyalty features and reviews are migrated to production
3. **Code Red disaster** — Someone drops the orders table in production
4. **Point-in-Time Recovery** — Lakebase PITR restores the dropped table

A customer-facing storefront makes these scenarios **visceral**:
- When orders are dropped, the storefront shows **"Orders Service Unavailable"** — just like real customers would see
- When PITR restores the data, the storefront **comes back to life**
- When the loyalty migration runs, tier badges and points **appear in real time**

## Dynamic Feature Detection

The storefront auto-detects database schema changes every 30 seconds using `server/schema_detector.py`. This module queries `information_schema` to discover what columns and tables exist, caches the result, and exposes feature flags via `/api/features`.

### How It Works

```
Lab runs DDL on production
        ↓ (schema changes)
schema_detector queries information_schema (30s cache)
        ↓
/api/features returns updated flags
        ↓ (frontend polls every 30s)
React UI conditionally renders new features
```

### Feature Flags

| Flag | True When | Storefront Effect |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| `reviews_active` | `reviews` table exists | Star ratings, review comments appear |
| `loyalty_active` | `loyalty_members` table + `loyalty_points` column | Tier badge, points, "Earn X pts" labels, loyalty banner |
| `order_priority_active` | `priority` column on `orders` | Priority badges on order cards |
| `email_verified_active` | `email_verified` column on `customers` | Verified badge in navbar |
| `orders_available` | `orders` table exists | Orders page works vs disaster state |
| `order_items_available` | `order_items` table exists | Best sellers, checkout, order details |
| `promotions_active` | `promotions` table exists (synced from UC) | Sale badges, discount prices, "Spring Sale Deals" section |

## Authentication & Connection Pattern

### App Resource Auth (Recommended)

The app uses the **Databricks App Resource** pattern for Lakebase connectivity. When you
add the Lakebase project as a database resource in the app settings:

1. The runtime auto-injects `PGHOST`, `PGUSER`, `PGDATABASE`, and `PGPORT` environment variables
2. The service principal's Postgres role is auto-created through the Lakebase OAuth system
3. The app's `OAuthConnection` class generates fresh tokens via `generate_database_credential`

This is configured in `app.yaml`:
```yaml
resources:
  - name: postgres
    type: postgres
```

> **Important**: Do NOT manually create the SP's Postgres role with `CREATE ROLE`.
> Manually-created roles are not linked to the Lakebase OAuth authentication system and
> will fail with "password authentication failed". Always use the app resource mechanism
> to create the role automatically.

After adding the resource, you still need to grant the SP permissions on the `ecommerce`
schema (see `setup_sp_roles_notebook.py`).

### Dual-Mode Auth (`server/config.py`)

The app detects whether it's running inside Databricks Apps or locally:

```python
IS_DATABRICKS_APP = bool(os.environ.get("DATABRICKS_APP_NAME"))

def get_workspace_client():
    if IS_DATABRICKS_APP:
        return WorkspaceClient()  # Auto-injected SP credentials
    else:
        return WorkspaceClient(profile="fe-vm-ben")  # CLI profile
```

### OAuth Connection Pool (`server/db.py`)

The `OAuthConnection` class generates a fresh OAuth token every time the pool creates a new connection:

```python
class OAuthConnection(psycopg.Connection):
    @classmethod
    def connect(cls, conninfo='', **kwargs):
        credential = w.postgres.generate_database_credential(endpoint=endpoint_name)
        kwargs['password'] = credential.token
        return super().connect(conninfo, **kwargs)
```

Key configuration:
- `max_lifetime=2700` (45 min) — recycles connections before the 1-hour OAuth token expires
- `connect_timeout=15` — prevents hanging connections if the endpoint is suspended
- `open=False` — pool opens lazily on first request, not at import time

## PITR Disaster Handling

When Lab 7.1 runs `DROP TABLE orders CASCADE`, both `orders` and `order_items` are dropped (CASCADE FK). The storefront handles this gracefully:

| Page | Behavior During Disaster |
|------|-------------------------|
| **Homepage** | Top Rated works (reviews survive). Best Sellers shows "temporarily unavailable" |
| **Shop** | Products still browsable with stock badges, ratings, and "Earn X pts" |
| **Product Detail** | Reviews still visible |
| **Cart** | Items visible but checkout shows "temporarily unavailable" error |
| **Orders** | Full-page "Orders Service Unavailable" with "Continue Shopping" button |

After PITR recovery, all features come back within 30 seconds (cache TTL). Priority badges may disappear since PITR restores the pre-Lab 6.3 schema. The post-recovery migration step in Lab 7.1 re-applies these columns.

### Tables That Survive the Disaster

| Table | Status | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| customers | Survives | No FK to orders |
| products | Survives | No FK to orders |
| inventory | Survives | No FK to orders |
| reviews | Survives | FK to products + customers only |
| loyalty_members | Survives | FK to customers only |
| orders | **DROPPED** | Directly dropped |
| order_items | **DROPPED** | FK to orders with ON DELETE CASCADE |
| promotions | Survives | Synced table, no FK to orders |

## Reverse ETL — Promotions via Synced Tables

Lab 3.1 demonstrates **Lakebase Synced Tables** (reverse ETL). A `promotions` Delta table
in Unity Catalog (`serverless_stable_339b90_catalog.ecommerce.promotions`) is synced to
the Lakebase `ecommerce` schema via a managed pipeline. The synced table appears in Postgres
as `promotions_synced_prod` (the name may vary depending on how it's created in the UI).

### Data Flow

```
Unity Catalog Delta Table          Lakebase Postgres                      Storefront
─────────────────────────          ─────────────────                      ──────────
ecommerce.promotions    ──sync──►  ecommerce.promotions_synced_prod ──►  Sale badges
(marketing team edits)             (read-only copy)                       Discount prices
                                                                          Promo deals section
```

### How It Works

1. Marketing team creates/updates the `promotions` Delta table in Unity Catalog
2. A Lakebase synced table pipeline copies the data to the `ecommerce` schema in Postgres
3. **Re-grant SP permissions** — synced tables are created by the sync pipeline (a different
   role), so `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` from Lab 1.2 doesn't cover them. Run
   `GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA ecommerce TO "<SP_CLIENT_ID>";` after the sync.
4. The storefront's `schema_detector` detects the table within 30 seconds via
   `get_promotions_table()`, which checks for `promotions_synced_prod` first, then `promotions`
5. The `shop.py` routes query the detected table to overlay sale badges and discount prices
6. The frontend renders `PromoBadge` components and `PriceDisplay` with strikethrough pricing

### Table Name Detection

The synced table name in Postgres may differ from the Delta table name. The storefront
handles this with `get_promotions_table()` in `schema_detector.py`:

```python
def get_promotions_table() -> str | None:
    if table_exists("promotions_synced_prod"):
        return "promotions_synced_prod"
    if table_exists("promotions"):
        return "promotions"
    return None
```

### Promotions Table Schema

```sql
id INT PRIMARY KEY          -- Promotion ID
product_id INT              -- FK to products
badge_text STRING           -- e.g., "SPRING SALE", "FLASH SALE", "CLEARANCE"
discount_pct DECIMAL(5,2)   -- Percentage off (e.g., 20.00)
sale_price DECIMAL(10,2)    -- Pre-computed discounted price
promo_type STRING           -- "percentage", "fixed", "bundle"
is_active BOOLEAN           -- Only active promos are shown
start_date TIMESTAMP        -- Promotion start
end_date TIMESTAMP          -- Promotion end
```

### Key Constraints

1. The Unity Catalog schema name **must match** the Lakebase Postgres schema name. Since the
   storefront reads from `ecommerce.*`, the Delta table must be in a UC schema named `ecommerce`
   (e.g., `serverless_stable_339b90_catalog.ecommerce.promotions`).

2. After each new synced table is created, **re-grant table permissions** to the app SP.
   Synced tables are created by the Lakebase sync pipeline (an internal role), not by your
   user account, so `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` does not apply to them.

## Demo Customer

The app simulates a logged-in customer:
- **Name**: Alice Smith
- **Customer ID**: 1
- **Email**: alice.smith.0@example.com

All cart operations and order history are scoped to this customer. The cart is stored in-memory (resets on redeploy), while orders persist in the database. After Lab 6.2, Alice has a loyalty tier and points balance that updates when she places orders.
