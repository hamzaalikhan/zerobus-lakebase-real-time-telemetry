# MAGIC # Lab 6.3: Resetting a Branch to Parent State
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **The Challenge:**  
# MAGIC You're developing a feature on a branch, but meanwhile another team pushes
# MAGIC schema changes to production. When you try to promote your migration, you discover
# MAGIC production has drifted. How do you handle it?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **The Lakebase Solution: Reset Branch to Production State**  
# MAGIC This will replace the data and schema in our branch with the latest data and schema from its parent. This allows us to align our branch with prod so we can develop on a fresh updated copy of production data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **We can also create a new branch from prod but this demo demonstrates resetting to prod**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## What You'll Learn
# MAGIC - How to detect that production has changed since your branch was created
# MAGIC - The **"re-set and re-test"** pattern for handling drift
# MAGIC - How to write migrations that are resilient to concurrent changes
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## How It Works
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC production ── another team adds email_verified ──── replay both migrations ── production (final)

# MAGIC ## 🎯 Summary
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | Step | What Happened |
# MAGIC |---|---|
# MAGIC | **Your branch** | Added `priority` column to orders |
# MAGIC | **Meanwhile** | Another team added `email_verified` to customers on production |
# MAGIC | **Detect drift** | Schema comparison revealed the gap |
# MAGIC | **Re-set Branch** | Reset branch from updated production |
# MAGIC | **Re-test** | Replayed your migration — validated it works alongside new changes |
# MAGIC | **Promote** | Replayed your migration on production (idempotent, safe) |
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Key Takeaways
# MAGIC 1. **Always compare schemas** before promoting migrations
# MAGIC 2. **Write idempotent DDL** (`IF NOT EXISTS`, `IF EXISTS`) so migrations can be replayed
# MAGIC 3. **Re-set branch from current production** when drift is detected (like `git rebase`) 
# MAGIC 4. Additionally, we can create a new branch. **Branches are cheap** — creating a v2 branch costs nothing (copy-on-write)
